Founded in 2019, HarrisTech is a Harris Student Organization (HSO) focused on how technology and policy interact and evolve.

The speed at which technology has grown to dominate every aspect of our social, political, and economic lives has far outpaced the policy-making process. We intend to serve as a forum for policy students to explore ways to bridge the gap between current policies and technology, as we strive to balance the power of innovation with the protection of the public interest.
